To target only the `<p>` elements directly within elements having the class "error", use a child combinator instead: 

```css
.error > p { color: red; }
```

The `>` child combinator ensures that only direct children of the `.error` element are selected.  This avoids the unintended styling of nested `<p>` elements.
